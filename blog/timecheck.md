This series relies on evaluation licenses within vSphere so every 60 days I reinstall this whole stack from scratch. I reformat the ESXi host from the latest vSphere release and update the guides to reflect any new changes to the process.

As a result, I've tried to automate as much as possible which has led to this series being created from what was originally some notes I used.

Here are the timings on how I arrived at this series taking TODO_UPDATE_THIS_WITH_TIME

1. Part 1 - Installing ESXi and vCenter: x minutes
1. Part 2 - Creating VM infrastructure for Kubernetes: x minutes
1. Part 3 - Creating Kubernetes cluster: x minutes
1. Part 4 - Creating Homelab tools: x minutes

Total time end-to-end: x minutes
